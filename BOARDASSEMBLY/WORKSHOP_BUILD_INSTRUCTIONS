SEE BELOW FOR INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD AND FLASH A BOARD FROM SCRATCH
//// TO BUILD AND FLASH A NEW BOARD

//// PROJECT HARDWARE: The project requires the following hardware components to build 
PROCESSOR - ESP32-S3
* Unexpected Maker ESP32-S3 Feather 
* Adafruit ESP-32 S3 Feather - either w/ or W/o PSRAM

RTC
* DS3231 by Analog Devices on an adafruit board if using a bare prototype
* Production boards come with a MAX31343 by Analog Devices installed

COMPONENTS TO BUILD PROTOTYPE BOARD FOR WORKSHOPS
* Domestic Light circuit board -  Rev G (Artist Prototype - no SMT assembly, white soldermask) or the ARTIST PROOF. 

PRODUCTION VERSION (WITH SMT COMPONENTS
* For the production board all that is needed is the board, case, and an ESP32-S3 Feather (either by unexpected maker or Adafruit)
* to build a Rev G artist prototype assembly you will need the following components
	* 2x tactile right angle button switches, E Switch TL1100CF160Q for switch S1 (adhoc mode), switch S2 (RST)
	* Adafruit AS7341 light sensor board https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-as7341-10-channel-light-color-sensor-breakout/pinouts
	* Adafruit DS3231 RTC board https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds3231-precision-rtc-breakout/pinouts
	* CR1220 coin cell
	* 3x 10k axial resistors OR adding same as SMD 0603 components on pads
	
* USB-C cable to connect to 5v USB power and / or computer

// SETUP AND CONFIG: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/// INITIAL SETUP AND FLASHING: DONE BEFORE SHIPPING OR IN WORKSHOP

//// NOTE ON AWS keys, certs and THINGNAME / UUID ////// 
These are assigned by admin and unique to each device 

INITIAL FACTORY SETUP / INIT
* Connect board via USB-C connector on ESP32 to your computer running the Arduino IDE with the DL_client_INIT.ino file open. 
* Edit the local copy of secrets.h to include:
    * your test network wifi info - be sure to remove when done before shipping the board.
    * the board UUID 
    * Endpoint for the device - may vary depending on location of device
    * device private key, and device cert to match the device UUID.
    
* PUT BOARD INTO BOOT MODE FOR FIRST FLASH: 
   * press and hold "boot" button on the board
   * while holding boot button press and release the "RST" button on the board or the RST button (S2) if correctly connected.
   * in the IDE Tools> Port select the new serial port that appears.
   * In the IDE Tools> Board select the correct board (UM Feather S3 or Adafruit Feather S3 no PSRAM)
   * Build and flash the DL_client.INIT file with the device secrets to the board.
* after the file is fully uploaded and complete, press the RST button to reset the board. Watch the Serial monitor for confimation of success.

LOAD THE CLIENT
* In the Arduino IDE open DL_client.ino
* Flash that to the board
* hit reset when complete and watch the serial monitor for confirmation. If you are on the test newtwork you set wifi info for in the INIT file it should connect to NTP, set the clock, then connect to AWS.
* To set a wifi network put the board into ADHOC or SETUP mode:
   * hold down S1 (the adhoc mode switch) and  press the reset button. 
   * release Button 1 / adhoc mode.
   * The Serial monitor should give you instructions to join the "Domestic Light" adhoc network and go to 192.168.4.1 to enter the local wifi info. 
* Connect to the adhoc mode wifi "Domestic Light" and go to 192.168.4.1
* Enter your local wifi SSID and password, the IP address you want to send OSC to (if desired), and copy the MAC ID shown on the browser into the MAC ID section. Hit submit. 
The wifi will disconnect. Press the RST button if the board doesn't automatically reboot. 


* at this point the board should be fully configured. Watch the serial monitor for output. you should see something like this:

* /////////////  START OF SAMPLE SERIAL MONITOR OUTPUT
* 14:37:27.380 -> IP address: xxx.xxx.x.xx // the boards IP address 
* 14:37:27.380 -> Listening for OSC on UDP port 15000 // the UDP port the board is listenting on
* 14:37:27.380 -> Connecting to AWS IOT  // AWS config info 
* 14:37:29.447 -> AWS IoT Connected! - subscribe and publish topics
